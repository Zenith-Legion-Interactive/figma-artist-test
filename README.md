Figma Artist Test

Task: Create a Social Media Graphic

Instructions:

- You are tasked with designing a social media graphic for a fictional fitness brand called "ZenithLife." This graphic will be used to promote an upcoming fitness challenge called "Summer Shape-Up Challenge."

Requirements:

- Dimensions: The graphic should be suitable for Instagram and Facebook posts. Use a square canvas (1080x1080 pixels) for Instagram and a horizontal canvas (1200x628 pixels) for Facebook.

- Visual Theme: The design should evoke a sense of energy, motivation, and the summer season. Incorporate fitness-related elements such as dumbbells, running shoes, or workout attire.

- Typography: Choose appropriate fonts and text styles for the title and any additional text. Include the following text elements:
  - Title: "Summer Shape-Up Challenge"
  - Subtitle: "Get Fit and Win Prizes!"
  - Date: "June 1 - August 31"
  - Hashtags: #ZenithLifeChallenge #SummerFitness

- Imagery: Include high-quality stock images or create your own illustrations to enhance the visual appeal. Ensure that any images used are relevant to fitness and summer.

- Color Scheme: Use a color palette that aligns with the fitness brand and the summer theme. You may incorporate the brand's primary colors (blue and green) and additional summer colors (e.g., warm yellows, oranges, or beachy blues).

- Layout and Composition: Arrange all the elements (text, images, icons) in a visually appealing and balanced manner. Pay attention to alignment, spacing, and hierarchy.

- Logo: Include the "ZenithLife" logo (provided as an attachment) in a tasteful manner that complements the overall design.

- Figma Collaboration: Share your Figma design file with dev.chris.dp@gmail.com and give editing access. Your collaborator should be able to add comments and make suggestions. Include a brief paragraph explaining how to collaborate within Figma.

- Export: Export the final design as two separate files (one for Instagram and one for Facebook) in a format suitable for posting on each platform (e.g., JPEG or PNG). Ensure that the exported files are of high quality.

Submission:

- Option 1: Share the Figma link to your design with dev.chris.dp@gmail.com 
- Option 2 ( Preferred ): Fork this repository and make a PR point back to master on this repo with the files requested together with the Figma link.

- Submit the exported Instagram and Facebook graphics along with the Figma link.

Evaluation Criteria:

The test should be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Creativity and Aesthetics
- Typography and Text Layout
- Visual Consistency with Branding
- Effective Use of Figma Features (collaboration, layers, components)
- Attention to Detail (alignment, spacing, image quality)
